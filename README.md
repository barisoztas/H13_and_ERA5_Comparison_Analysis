# H13_and_ERA5_Comparison_Analysis
This project is about statistically comparing two snow density products : H13 and ERA5

This project is done for monthly ERA5 and H13 products between the years of 2013 and 2019. H13 is changed to a monthly product & ERA5 is changed to raster data (initially netCDF).

This project included statistical analysis like correlation analysis, mean and standart deviation of a location, and zonal statistics.
